# Advanced Reddit Analysis Dashboard

Hey there! This is a project I put together as a way to dive into R, learn more about data analysis, and have some fun with Reddit data along the way. This dashboard was built using **Shiny** in R and brings together several visualization tools to explore the depths of Reddit comments and posts. From text analysis to temporal patterns, I tried to cover a broad spectrum of analyses in this project.

## Project Motivation

I’ve always been fascinated by how people interact on Reddit and wanted to see what kinds of patterns could be uncovered in the data. As someone new to R, this project also gave me a great chance to learn the language, experiment with different libraries, and understand the workflow of building an interactive data dashboard.

## Features of the Dashboard

This dashboard is designed to provide a well-rounded exploration of Reddit data with the following key features:

1. **Overview Statistics**
   - Displays total comments, total posts, and the number of unique subreddits in the dataset.

2. **Text Analysis**
   - **Word Cloud & Frequency**: Visualize popular words across Reddit comments.
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the average sentiment across subreddits.
   - Includes a slider to control the number of top words shown.

3. **Temporal Patterns**
   - **Hourly, Daily, and Weekly Patterns**: See when Reddit users are most active.
   - **Sentiment Over Time**: Optionally overlay sentiment trends on activity patterns.

4. **User & Subreddit Analysis**
   - **Subreddit Activity Stats**: View top subreddits based on comment count, sentiment, or score.
   - **Table View**: Sort and explore subreddit-level statistics.

## The Data

I used a dataset of Reddit comments and posts, which I imported using `readxl`. This allowed me to practice data preprocessing techniques like converting timestamps and dealing with missing values. The data includes columns for comment content, timestamps, scores, sentiment ratings, and more, making it great for a deep dive into community behavior.

## Libraries Used

To make this project work, I had to install quite a few R packages. Here are some of the major ones I used:

- **tidyverse**: Essential for data manipulation and visualization.
- **shiny** and **shinythemes**: Made the dashboard possible.
- **wordcloud2**: For generating word clouds.
- **plotly**: To add interactivity to visualizations.
- **lubridate**: Handy for handling dates and times.
- **tidytext**: Allowed me to tokenize and filter words for text analysis.

## How to Run the Dashboard

If you’d like to try this project out for yourself:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/reddit-analysis-dashboard.git
   cd reddit-analysis-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**  
   Make sure to have `pacman` installed to simplify package loading:
   ```R
   if (!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
   pacman::p_load(
     tidyverse, shiny, tidytext, lubridate, wordcloud2, textdata, igraph,
     plotly, readxl, DT, reshape2, ggplot2, shinythemes, scales
   )
   ```

3. **Run the App**  
   Start the Shiny app from within R:
   ```R
   shiny::runApp()
   ```

   This should launch the dashboard in your browser.

## A Few Challenges I Encountered

Since this was my first real project in R, I had to navigate a few obstacles:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Working with text data, I realized the importance of tokenizing and cleaning it up to get meaningful results.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: I explored different libraries and sentiment lexicons to find one that made sense for Reddit comments.
- **Time Conversions**: Timestamps in datasets can be tricky, especially converting from Unix time, but `lubridate` helped smooth that out.

## What I Learned

This project was an awesome introduction to R, and I learned so much about data wrangling, visualization, and building an interactive app. It’s one thing to read about these techniques and another to actually implement them with a large dataset. I’m already thinking about ways to expand this, maybe even incorporating machine learning for more advanced sentiment analysis in the future.

## Future Enhancements

Here are a few ideas I’m considering for the next iteration:
- **Enhanced NLP Models**: Integrate machine learning models to better classify comment sentiments.
- **User Profiling**: Analyze users based on their activity levels or sentiment trends.
- **Real-Time Data**: Maybe even look into streaming Reddit data using its API for live analysis.
